# Installation
Depending on your Operating System, you need to place the stuff inside the zip in a certain directory, except if you are an mac user (refer to "MAC INSTALLATION").
The root directory needs to look like this:

->mpv

-->input.conf

-->mpv.conf

--->Shaders

--->script-opts

--->scripts

Inside the mpv.conf, there are profile switches. choose them as you need them.
# Windows Path
"C:\Users\YOURNAME\AppData\Roaming\mpv"

On Windows, Intel IGPUs cannot upscale whilst dithering with error diffusion options.

Disable Error Diffusion, or Upscaling, depending on what looks better to your eyes. There are comments in the code to guide you.
