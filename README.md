or just make a pull request if you have any recommendations, if i like it, i put it in.

# Installation
put the stuff from the zip in the "C:\Users\YOURNAME\AppData\Roaming\mpv" folder so every mpv installation of yours understands where it is.
path is different on linux, dunno where, it depends on your distro. you probably know where it is. my guess is /home/.config/mpv.
THERE IS NO DEFAULT. CHANGE YOUR DESIRED SETTINGS NAME.
